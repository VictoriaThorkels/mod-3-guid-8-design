Link to original website: [](https://www.ferdin.is/)

When starting this guide. I looked over the original wbsite and wrote down my initial thoughts, problems and how I would fix them.

Cons: what dose the website do?, to much information everywere!, navigation and just all the information is cramped, needs more white space, childsites look disconnected from the home page, footer has tangled information (news and special deals in the same list but no way to distinguish which is which.

Needs: assortment of information, simplification, organization, a " how it works" section, an "about us" section.

Ideas to fix cons: take everything out of nav bar and but into sections, have "popular trips" section, re-organize and simplify homepage, great space beetwen sections.

Key info: none-guided-trips.

Font: I used two fonts, Marcellus and Poppins. Marcellus for larger info like titles or inportant info like the header slogan. Poppins for less important information with a smaller size. For buttons I used Poppins but with the Semibold look, as to draw attention and distinguish.

Colors: For my primary color I wanted somthing "clean" and "sleek" what better than white? for my secondary color I wanted something the connect the logo to the site, so I went with a orange color the was simmilar to the logo but not as harsh. And for one extra color to make seperations i went with gray, light and dark.

White-space: Was added all over the website to make it look simple, sleek and clutter-free.

Boxes/Frames: All boxes or frames have a slightly curved corner to make it more soft and not as sharp. But no so much as to lose the square shape.

Header: I took all the info from the nav bar and split them into two dropdown menu functions, "Trips" and "Destinations". Trips whould show all the pre-planed trips to Asia that you could book and destinations would show you all the destinations in Asia that the company has to offer.in addition I added a "book your trip" button and made it stand out with the orange color that it would be an obvious button. Orange was my secondary color, here I used it to connect the logo more to the website. The maine image that is spread over the section is one of an asian sunset I picked this photo to connect the primary-color and make it feel nice, comforting and calm, just like the process.
I wanted the users initial focus to be on a slogan that could make it ovious what kind of service the site offers. To make it stand out I made the text significantly larger then the rest of the header. Below the slogan i put a short description of the sites purpose, and to make it ovious that it is connected to the slogan but not as important i but it right beneath and in a smaller font size with the font poppins. The slogan and description text were placed in the sky section of the image so that it would not "disappear" in the mountains.

Homepage, section 1: "Our Most Popular Trips" section was added with the intention to attract users by making it easy to get information and book your trip. I had minimal information as not to confuse the user or clutter the area. I but the main focus on the title by making it oviously larger and in a different font. right below the title I but a short description of the sections purpose. To devide the three most popular trips I but a frame around them and added a drop shadow to make them stand out even more. In the box I have a title  in a larger and different font with a image bellow, a short description of the destination, the duration of the trip and then a button (orange to stand out and connect to the logo/secondary color), the text is also in semibold to further indecate a function is in place. The photos are vivid and pleasing to the eye. 

Homepage, section 2: "How It Works", I added a filler text here. When I looked at the original website I did not fully understand the point of the site until talking to the owner of the business. From just that one con I felt that a "How It Works" section was a key aspect of the homepage. To make it visualy pleasing I added a image. To distinguish the section from the previous one I but a light background over the area.

Homepage, section 3: "About" similar to the section above  but no gray frame, rather a white one with a white space section to not make it feel to cluttered. 

Homepage, section 4: "Contact Us", this time I added a small orange line to make it clear that these to sections were seperate areas. I had the title smaller but still close enough to make it connected. Light gray squares were added for the fill out sections and a light gray font for the "First name" and "Last name" to give a discription but at the same time not as importand as the "Name" text. A orange semibold button was added to the bottom right corner to tie it all together. The Image is of an enterance to a temple in Asia, the reasoning for this pick rather than one of the beach was to make it belong to the section. To make the user subconsciosly feel like it was welcoming you one step closer to booking their dream vacation the image of an enterance to the door of Asia. BAM!

And to end the section a simple footer with icons to other social platforms and other info. This section is in a dark-ish gray color to make it an ovious footer.

Thank you for reading me:)
